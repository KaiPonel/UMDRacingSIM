Welcome to the Admin Documentation
=================================
# Before you continue
This documentation is **correct** for you if you have access to Carla already (either locally or on the Cluster of the OVGU) and want to do the following things:
- **Start Working** - Start the Container upon getting access to the Cluster. 
- **Write Scripts** - Creating an actual simulation using python scripts.
- **Manage Maps** - Import, Create, Delete or Change maps.
- **Manage vehicles** - Import, Create, Delete or Change Vehicles.

If this is not the case, please refer to the [Mainpage](README.md) or the [Admin Documentation](Admin.md)
