Create new map 
=====

To add a new map in Carla (or Unreal Engine), we use the Roadrunner (https://de.mathworks.com/products/roadrunner.html) software from MathWorks.

You need a license for this software. The OVGU has a MathLab license, but Roadrunner is not included in this license. 
To get this license, you have to contact URZ (https://www.urz.ovgu.de/MATLAB.html).)


Tips for installing Roadrunner:

Now that you have a license, install Roadrunner as described above (link). Remember that your computer must be logged in!
